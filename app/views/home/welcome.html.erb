    <p>That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. Bruce... I'm god. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. </p>

    <p>The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. well, what is it today? more spelunking? cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd.</p>
