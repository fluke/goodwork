    <p>That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. Bruce... I'm god. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. </p>
